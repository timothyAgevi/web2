<!-- You have been asked to develop a program for printing out 
a simple telephone bill. The program will input the following 
details:

?	Name of customer
?	Address
?	Telephone Number 
?	Previous meter reading
?	Current meter reading

The program will calculate the number of units used, 
and compute the bill charged using the following rates:


No. OF UNITS	COST PER UNIT (Kshs)
> 0 and <= 100	2.50
>100 and <=200	2.25
>200 and <=350	1.90
>350	        1.65

The program will then print out the bill details.
?	Name of customer
?	Address
?	Telephone Number
?	Previous meter reading
?	Current meter reading
?	Consumption
?	Bill to pay -->
