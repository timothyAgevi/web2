In the recent Africa Cup of Nations a database student 
designed the following schema to track the performance
of teams and players. Any player who scored had his goals stored 
on the goals attribute of the table players. A player is uniquely 
identified by the player-code where as a country is uniquely 
identified by the country-code. The extension of the student\92s 
schema is shown by the two tables.
Table 1: PLAYER
